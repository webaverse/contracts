Note that the\n recipient will be charged regardless of the execution result of the relayed call (i.e. if it reverts or not).\n The relay request was originated by `from` and will be served by `relay`. `encodedFunction` is the relayed call\n calldata, so its first four bytes are the function selector. The relayed call will be forwarded `gasLimit` gas,\n and the transaction executed with a gas price of at least `gasPrice`. ``relay``'s fee is `transactionFee`, and the\n recipient will be charged at most `maxPossibleCharge` (in wei). `nonce` is the sender's (`from`) nonce for\n replay attack protection in {IRelayHub}, and `approvalData` is a optional parameter that can be used to hold a signature\n over all or some of the previous values.\n Returns a tuple, where the first value is used to indicate approval (0) or rejection (custom non-zero error code,\n values 1 to 10 are reserved) and the second one is data to be passed to the other {IRelayRecipient} functions.\n {acceptRelayedCall} is called with 50k gas: if it runs out during execution, the request will be considered\n rejected. A regular revert will also trigger a rejection."

Note that the recipient will be charged regardless of the execution result of the relayed call (i.e. if it reverts or not). The relay request was originated by `from` and will be served by `relay`. `encodedFunction` is the relayed call calldata, so its first four bytes are the function selector. The relayed call will be forwarded `gasLimit` gas, and the transaction executed with a gas price of at least `gasPrice`. ``relay``'s fee is `transactionFee`, and the recipient will be charged at most `maxPossibleCharge` (in wei). `nonce` is the sender's (`from`) nonce for replay attack protection in {IRelayHub}, and `approvalData` is a optional parameter that can be used to hold a signature over all or some of the previous values. Returns a tuple, where the first value is used to indicate approval (0) or rejection (custom non-zero error code, values 1 to 10 are reserved) and the second one is data to be passed to the other {IRelayRecipient} functions. {acceptRelayedCall} is called with 50k gas: if it runs out during execution, the request will be considered rejected. A regular revert will also trigger a rejection."
